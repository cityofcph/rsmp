<h2>General concepts<a class="headerlink" href="#general-concepts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Coordination between Traffic Light Controllers (TLC) implies that several
intersections are controlled together in a coordinated control mode at
local or central level. Regardless of operational mode, prerequisites
are - among other things, that TLC:s must use the same time plan and must
be in synchronous operation.</p>
<p>Local coordination can be applied in minor systems (up to 4
intersections). Control will in these systems be made with a common and
variable cycle depending on the traffic.</p>
<p>Central coordination can be applied in major systems (up to some 20
intersections or more). In central coordination a special master (M),
a combination of master/controller (M/C) or a system of cableless linking
is used. Within the system control bits should be sent according to time
plans designed in advance with selected and fixed cycle times for
different traffic levels. In the individual intersection a certain
smaller degree of traffic adaption should be allowed, however, only
within the framework of the fixed and given cycle time.</p>
<p>The two coordination levels should be possible to combine. During peak
hours should e.g. the entire traffic signal area be coordinated at
central level while a split in locally coordinated sub areas should be
possible during normal off-peak hours.</p>
<p>![Figure 1: Types of coordination](img/types_of_coordination.png)</p>
<p>Since there are variants of coordination which are not strictly
centralized but still uses the same principles of communication, the
term _coordination with synchronized cycle <a href="#id10"><span class="problematic" id="id11">counter_</span></a> is used rather than
_central <a href="#id12"><span class="problematic" id="id13">coordination_</span></a> here on after.</p>
<p>![Figure 2: Coordination](img/coordination.png)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="coordination-type-local-coordination">
<h2>Coordination type “Local coordination”<a class="headerlink" href="#coordination-type-local-coordination" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Local coordination is achieved by supplementing the TLC:s control bits
of the signal groups with special control bits from signal group(s) in
another intersection.</p>
<p>This can be achieved with the following status modes:
- “Front edge of green wave”, which is normally sent when conflicting</p>
<blockquote>
<div>signal group in downstream traffic lights turns yellow</div></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>“Rear edge of green wave”, which is normally sent when demand for
green ends or yellow is sent to downstream TLC.</li>
</ul>
<p>Front edge of green wave normally prevents signal groups in other TLC:s
to start and rear edge of green wave normally extends signal groups in
green, normally when demand for green ends, or yellow.</p>
<p>Commands should be able to be sent from an optional change in signal
group status and should additionally be able to be supplemented with a
timer which initiates counts from these changes.</p>
<p>Variation in programming to achieve desired functionality according to
specifications may vary without having any impact on coordination
communication.</p>

<p>![Figure 4: Rear edge](img/rear_edge.png)</p>

<div class="section" id="coordination-with-synchronized-cycle-counter">
<h2>Coordination with synchronized cycle counter<a class="headerlink" href="#coordination-with-synchronized-cycle-counter" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Coordination with synchronized cycle counter should typically be possible
to operate in multiple time plans with optional signal group sequence
split and/or cycle time.</p>
<p>The cycle time of the time plans should be possible to select in
increments of one second up to at least 180 seconds.</p>
<p>Signal group(s) should typically be able to have green 2 times per cycle.</p>
<p>Change between time plans should typically be possible at optional points
in the cycle, at different points in different time plans. Change
must not follow so that fixed times such as red/yellow, minimum green,
pedestrian green and green/yellow will be reduced or excluded.
Coordination should be achieved by exchanging the normal start bits
against special control bits which should be possible to send per one
second steps.</p>
<p>If control bits to the local TLC is missing for 120 seconds, the TLC
should automatically revert to a predetermined back up or safety mode.
If/when the control bits returns, the TLC should automatically return to
coordination.</p>
<p>The control bits, arranged and time distributed within the framework of
the cycle of the time plan, should give the coordinated installation a
certain signal group sequence, split and offset between TLC’S.</p>
<p>The control bits should be possible to use internally in a TLC or be
possible to send externally to another TLC which consequently also
should be able to receive externally incoming control bits. Together
with new control bits, the internal logic of the TLC should in
other aspects proceed normally, among other things, for
communication between the signal groups.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="coordination-with-control-bits">
<h2>Coordination with control bits<a class="headerlink" href="#coordination-with-control-bits" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Coordination with internal control bits</strong></p>
<p>With internal control bits, only information about time plan/traffic
situation, initialization and clock sync needs to be sent and received.</p>
<p><strong>Coordination with external control bits</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the control bits in the previous paragraph, start bits
and stop bits must be sent and received.</p>
<p>TLC:s should also be able to receive external start/stop bits. If the
active time plan is controlled by the other TLC, it must also be able
to receive subscription/request of e. g traffic data, detector logic
and signal groups status etc.</p>

<div class="section" id="general-rsmp-requirements">
<h2>General RSMP requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#general-rsmp-requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Communication must be established directly between TLC:s. This demands
the following general requirements:
- In every TLC, it must be possible to connect to other TLC:s and to</p>
<blockquote>
<div>receive connections from other TLC:s (client-server).</div></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The TLC must have a list with every connected and communicating TLC
with editable communication parameters for each individual unit.</li>
<li>The mentioned list above includes IP-addresses and signal exchange
lists for every connected TLC.</li>
<li>The TLC must be configurable with signal exchange lists for every TLC
that communication is intended with.  The signal exchange lists
contain important information such as <strong>siteId</strong> and <strong>component-id</strong>
which are needed to establish communication. Relevant parts of signal
exchange lists must therefore be easily editable, in particular
<strong>siteId</strong>, <strong>component-id</strong>, etc.</li>
<li>The TLC must be able to communicate with the supervision system at the
same as communicating between TLC:s.</li>

<h2>Functional requirements of the TLC<a class="headerlink" href="#functional-requirements-of-the-tlc" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

time plan/traffic situation and synchronize their cycle timers.</p>

<li>One leader TLC should be able to communicate with up to 20 follower
